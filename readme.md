# shoePricePredictor

## How to use

Install the required packages using `pip` or `conda`.

**(Optional)** run the `scrapeNike.py`

Run the Jupyter notebook using `jupyter notebook` in your terminal

## What does this do?

It finds a convoluted way to determine if a Nike shoe is expensive (by default that is set at $120 and above, but feel free to change it in the `scrapeNike.py`, line 61.)

Of course, we already have the price of the shoe, but that's not fun and TFDF is bad with having many possible outcomes on such a small dataset.

Instead use colors, exclusitivity of the shoe and more!
